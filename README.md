Summary and Motivation
Air quality has started to decline at a fast rate over the past few years. Air pollution poses health risks and is linked to a number of chronic and short-term diseases. With the increased health risks, there is an immediate need to control air pollution. We have taken an initiative to resolve this issue of air pollution.
This project is aimed at improving the air quality. We have invented the Smart Air Purifier which helps humans to live in an environment free from air pollution. For the purification purpose, we have used  HEPA filter as the main filter, air filter used in cars and hand made filter using doctor cotton and net. These filters all together restrict the Ozone gas (harmful for human health) while letting the fresh air pass through.
This Smart Air Purifier is fully Automatic. We have used two MQ135 sensors to detect the amount of toxic gas present in the air in surroundings before and after purification. The performance of the system is continuously displayed on screen.
