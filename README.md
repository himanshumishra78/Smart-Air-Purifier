# Smart-Air-Purifier
Smart Air Purifier by team Compiler Karishma
# Summary and Motivation
Air quality has started to decline at a fast rate over the past few years. Air pollution posses health risks and is linked to a number of chronic and short-term diseases. With the increased health risks, there is an immediate need to control air pollution. We have taken an initiative to resolve this issue of air pollution.
This project is aimed at improving the air quality. We have invented the Smart Air Purifier which helps humans to live in an environment free from air pollution. For the purification purpose, we have used  HEPA filter as the main filter, air filter used in cars and hand made filter using doctor cotton and net. These filters all together restrict the Ozone gas (harmful for human health) while letting the fresh air pass through.
This Smart Air Purifier is fully Automatic. We have used two MQ135 sensors to detect the amount of toxic gas present in the air in surroundings before and after purification. The performance of the system is continuously displayed on screen.
This purifier is smart enough to automatically move forward to the area with higher concentration of air contaminants when the air in itâ€™s  surrounding is purified. This is done using the Line Following technique and IR sensor. Black stripping is done in front of IR sensor.    
Servo Motor, platform and wheels help the filter to move from one place to another. For the intake of air into the system, 6000 rpm motor is used.
## Work done till Now:-
1. Integration of deployed sensor testing done with Arduino Uno.
2. Movable Platform of purifier system is almost ready.
3. Testing of filtration chamber is going on....
